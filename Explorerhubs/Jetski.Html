            <h2 >JetSki in USA</h2>

            JetSki racing is a water sport similar to powerboat racing, in which riders use jet skis to compete. The sport is mostly practiced at a recreational level in several countries around the world. At a competitive level, Jet Ski racing is popular in the United States and Australia. Jet Ski is a brand name for a personal watercraft. Personal watercraft (PWC) are typically small and easy to transport, with a motorcycle-like riding position and the capacity to carry a driver and up to two passengers. The two major types of jet skis are the stand-up and sit-down categories. The latter offer comfortable rides for 2-3 passengers, while riding a stand-up is always a solo activity. There are six common categories of watercraft: Rec-Lite, Recreation, Luxury and Performance, Tow Sports and Sport Fishing. The original concept of a PWC can be traced back to a man by the name of Clayton Jacobsen. His simple craft was designed to let people ski across water without the need to use a larger boat. The Jet Ski didn't come into the spotlight until Kawasaki decided to mass produce them, giving it the name we know today.
            Jetski has a jet propulsion engine, which has an impeller that uses rotating fan blades to suck water into the engine and then forcefully eject it. These two motions—sucking in water and then ejecting it back out—are what propel the jet ski forward. Jet skis have throttles, similar to those on motorcycles.<br>
          <br><h2>Why do people choose Jetski?</h2>
          Jet skiing is a fun way to enjoy water. There are some people who do not like to go swimming. If you go Jetski, you can enjoy the water without having to get into it. All you have to do is just hop on and have fun.

          <h2>Benefits</h2>
          Jet skiing on a regular basis – for about 30 minutes a day or more – can substantially improve your overall cardiovascular endurance. In turn, this will give you more sustained energy for a long period of time, allowing you to exercise longer, whether for working out or recreation. Enhanced cardiovascular system – Jet skiing provides a fun way to do your cardiovascular workout and enhance the heart's function. It boosts blood circulation, ensuring your organs and tissues are receiving sufficient oxygen and other nutrients.<br>

        <p><h2 id="Lake">Lake Placid </h2>
            Lake Placid, New York, is settled in the Adirondack Mountains and is just south of Mirror Lake. The lake is named Mirror Lake for a reason and is irresistible to jet skiers once they see it. The lake is one mile long and 128 acres, and with the mountain range as a gorgeous backdrop to water activities, it is a perfect place to go watercrafting. You have plenty of space and could even get to East Lake without leaving the water.
            The town of Lake Placid offers a variety of opportunities for tourists beyond water sports. The town is surrounded by mountains, making it a great place for hiking. Or if you’re
            looking for a less strenuous adventure, the town itself has plenty of parts to explore, from the Lake Placid Olympic Museum to the Historical Society Depot Museum housed in an old train station.<br><br>

        <p><h2 id="Lake"> Lake Michigan </h2>
            Lake Michigan is a wildly popular place for jet skiing, as it spans so many big cities. The great lake gives the people of Milwaukee, Green Bay and Chicago, as well as big cities on the west side of Michigan like Grand Rapids, a nearby coastline.
            Because the lake is so far north, it’s most popular in the summer when it is warmer. The 307-mile-long lake is the second-largest Great Lake and provides quiet waters to jet skiers, making it great for beginners. There are also parts of the lake designated for professionals, so jet skiers of every skill set can participate.
            The northern part of the lake is not traversed as often, as it is colder and not as developed as the south. The south has plenty to see with all of the metropolitan areas along the coast. And with so many cities nearby, you’re sure to find rental options if you don’t have your own PWC yet.

When the lake is full, it covers nearly 65,000 acres and has over 1,255 miles of shoreline, making it one of the largest human-made lakes by volume east of the Mississippi River.
            Because of its size, Lake Cumberland is perfect for heading out on a PWC as well as a number of other boating activities that won’t disrupt the water too much. The shoreline boasts a variety of activities other than jet skiing to get involved in as well.
