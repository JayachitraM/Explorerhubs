            <h2></h2>
            <p> Modern whitewater rafting as we know it dates back to 1842 when Lieutenant John Fremont began 
              exploring Colorado's Platte River. During this time, he and inventor Horace H. Day created a rubber raft 
              featuring four rubber cloth tubes and a wrap-around floor to help survey the Great Plains and Rocky 
              Mountains areas. In earlier days, people used to transport things using rafts, hence the name of rafting 
              came into the picture. In 1842, Lieutenant John Fremont of the U.S. Army first introduced rafting 
              expedition on the Platte River. In ancient days, rafts were made from rubber cloth tubes and a 
              floor.Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to 
              navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough 
              water.</p><br>
        <h2>Why Do People Choose Rafting ?</h2>
        Rafting lets you feel like you are a part of nature. You can feel the water on your skin, see the animals and plants all around you, and hear the birds calling. Rafting immerses you in nature so that you can get back to feeling your best. <br><br>

          This Kaituna River Whitewater Rafting tour is amazing for all those who want an unforgettable 
          experience full of adrenaline and amazing views. It starts at $115 NZD, and hotel pick-up can be

          Highway just outside Rotorua.Once you hit the water, your raft will take you on the rapids of the Kaituna 
          River through a subtropical rainforest in a deep canyon. You’ll slip down the Tutea Falls and can jump 
          into the river from 3-meter (10 ft) high cliffs. This is easily one of the most popular whitewater rafting 
          tours in NZ and also the most extreme, made famous by Tutea Falls. That’s right, you’ll actually raft over 
          a waterfall! This waterfalls is 7 meters (23 ft) high, so this whitewater rafting experience isn’t for the 
          light-hearted. <br> <br>

        <h2>Essentials equipment for Rafting </h2>
        
          <h3>1. Swimsuit</h3> 
          Being on the river all day means being wet all day. So you want to have swimwear that you’ll be 
          comfortable wearing for long periods of time that is practical, rather than fashionable.
          <br><br><h3>2. Headlamp</h3>
          A headlamp is essential for maneuvering around riverside camps at night, allowing you to work handsfree while assembling tents, cooking dinner or playing games. Opt for headlamps with long-lasting or 
          rechargeable batteries so you won’t be left in the dark at an inopportune moment. 
          <br><br><h3>3. Wet/Body Wipes </h3>
          Camping on white-water rafting adventures usually means no showers for days on end. There will 
          probably be plenty of options to swim in the river, but it’s nice to be able to freshen up at the end of a 
          long day before getting into your camp clothes. 
          <br><br><h3>4. Rain Gear</h3>
          Getting wet is all part of a whitewater rafting experience. But once you’re settled into camp at night, 
          you might prefer to stay dry. A lightweight waterproof jacket is a great addition in case the skies open in 
          the afternoon while you’re trying to set up camp or in the evening in the midst of preparing dinner.
          <br><br><h3>5. Long Underwear</h3> 
          Long underwear or thermals are a practical solution for an added level of warmth, being light in weight 
          but heavy on insulation. They are ideal for wearing between upper layers around camp or inside your 
          sleeping bag at night, doubling as pajamas. 
          <br><br><h3>6. Hand Sanitizer </h3>
          If you’re not comfortable just washing your hands in the river water, consider packing some hand 
          sanitizer to use before eating meals. It will help to eliminate any germs, bacteria or viruses, with those 
          containing a minimum of 60% alcohol preferable.<br><br>
