          <h2>Essentials for Mountain Biking: </h2>
        <p>Getting ready to hit the dirt? This comprehensive list for mountain bikers is designed to prevent you from forgetting anything important on your next ride. Mountain bike accessories that are essential to Always bring on a ride.
           </p>
           <br>
          <h3>1.Helmet </h3>
          <p>Even if you have cat-like reflexes on a bike, always landing rubber side down, you NEED to rock a helmet. With that being said, in most situations you don’t need a full-face helmet unless you’re doing full-on downhill or aggressive enduro riding. Nearly every mountain bike helmet on the market comes with one. It serves two purposes. One is to provide a bit of shade against sun rays and help provide better vision. The second is to give your face some protection from low hanging branches and other debris.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>2.Tubeless repair kit  </h3>
          <p>Tubeless plugs are the mountain biker’s best friend, and can be easily applied to a hole in the tyre using a specialist plug tool to seal the hole ready for reinflation. One of the most common mechanical issues on the trail is a puncture, Larger cuts or slices might not work with plugs, so you’ll need to remove the tyre to install a tyre boot and tube. Many brands now offer complete kits for tubeless repairs, including reamers, plugs and application tools.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>3.Spare tubes </h3>
          <p>If your tubeless nightmare is beyond repair, or if you need to fix a punctured inner tube, it’s probably time to pop a replacement tube in there. They may be a little bulky, but it really does pay to carry spare inner tubes, even if you have your tyres set up tubeless. It may sound like a lot, but for big rides it’s well worth taking two spare tubes, as double flats do happen.
            </p>
          <br>
          <h3>4. Patch kit</h3>
          <p>These small kits can be a lifesaver when it comes to being able to reuse a punctured tube, and can sometimes even be used for other applications such as patching the inside of a tyre. Worthy of a spot in your ride kit, the humble tube-patching kit is an essential regardless of your tyre setup.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>5.Mini Tyre pump</h3>
          <p>Mini hand pump though a pump can be used over and over again which, alas, may come in handy. Whether you’ve ‘burped’ a bit of pressure out of your tyres or have had a puncture, a tyre pump is key to getting you back to that sweet-running optimum. Look for a high-volume option for mountain bike tyres, rather than a high-pressure pump which works better for narrower road bike tyres. Whereas a pump can be used again and again for years to come.</p>
