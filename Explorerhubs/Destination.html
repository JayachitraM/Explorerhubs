             If your core relationship desire is adventure it means you enjoy exploring new things and challenging the status quo. You want to feel excited, and you're drawn to things that are on the risky side. You seek out pleasure and desire.

          <p class="post-description">Skydiving is a term used to describe the sport of 
            freefalling (usually from an aeroplane) through the air 
            prior to opening a parachute. Skydiving is a great 
            adventure sport for giving your body a sensory overload 
            and massive adrenaline rush
            skydiving, also called parachuting, use of a parachute—
            for either recreational or competitive purposes—to slow 
            a diver's descent to the ground after jumping from an 
            airplane or other high place.</p>

          <p class="post-description">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface air supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance. The name “scuba”, an acronym for “Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. To dive into the deep oceans and to explore the world beneath is unexplainable in words. And to experience something like this, you need to go scuba diving in India. 
            Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.</p>

          sport of flying paragliders. It is lightweight, free-flying, foot launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The 
          pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon like 'pod' 
          suspended below a fabric wing. It is a motor free sport 
          practised by the adventurous people.
           It is weather dependent adventure aviation sport, done by 
          trained pilots either solo or with passenger. Paragliding wings 
          are specially designed aerofoil shape canopies called

        <p class="post-description">Surfing is a great way to stay in shape, have fun, and enjoy the outdoors. Surfing can be a great 
          way to relax, have fun, and get some exercise. It's also a great way to meet new people and see 
          new places
          Surfing in India is growing in popularity. There are some outstanding spots along the country's 
          vast coastline where you can catch a wave and also learn to surf. The only issue is that the waves 
          aren't consistent and the surf does fall flat at times. You need to be at the right place at the right 
          time!
          Waves generally rise between three and five feet most of the year. Bigger and faster world-class 
          waves (of over eight feet), suited to advanced or professional surfers, can be experienced just 
          before and during the monsoon from May to September. You can expect plenty of rain with them 
          though! The big swells decline from October to December, after which conditions return to 
          normal gentle waves.</p>

            define the almost similar types of aircrafts in different countries which does not comply with the 
            international airworthiness standards and can be used only for sport or hobby flying or air racing.
            Ultralight in the USA means a single seat aircraft which can carry only the pilot and is used by 
            him only for sport flying. No licence is needed in the USA to fly an Ultralight. Flying for an 
            American citizen is their birth right, as aviation was born in the United States, this has been 
            added in their constitution.
            If one more seat it added to the Aircraft, the category changes to Light Sport Aircraft / Amateur 
            Built Aircraft, hence medical and Pilots licence becomes mandatory. In Thailand Ultralight is an 
            aircraft one or two seat, with all up weight of 500 Kgs, used for hobby or sport flying and 
            Ultralight or Sporting Pilots License is mandatory.In Canada, a Microlight is called an Advanced 
            Ultralight and has the same meaning as that of a Microlight in Indian regulations, Microlight 
            Pilots Licence is needed to Fly.</p>

          <p class="post-description">Does Base jumping sound familiar? Then you already know what it means. In case you don’t, 
            B.A.S.E stands for Building, Antenna, Span, and Earth, the four most common fixed objects 
            adventurers like to parachute from. In short, the world’s most dangerous sports activity.Often 
            people confuse BASE jumping with skydiving because they both involve jumping and 
            parachuting with a parachute that looks similar when it’s open. However, the difference is huge.
            Skydiving involves jumping from a moving object (airplane, helicopter) with a parachute and a 
            reserve. BASE jumpers, on the other hand, jump from fixed objects using a one-parachute 
            system. Some of them wear wingsuits. Talk about an adrenaline rush? While skydivers open 
            their chutes at around 2,000 feet (609.6 meters), the minimum BASE jump height is around 200 
            feet (60.96 meters). This means that BASE jumpers have around 15 seconds to deploy their 
            parachutes and land safely.</p>

            JetSki racing is a water sport similar to powerboat racing, in which riders use jet skis to compete. The sport is mostly practiced at a recreational level in several countries around the world. At a competitive level, Jet Ski racing is popular in the United States and Australia. Jet Ski is a brand name for a personal watercraft. Personal watercraft (PWC) are typically small and easy to transport, with a motorcycle-like riding position and the capacity to carry a driver and up to two passengers. The two major types of jet skis are the stand-up and sit-down categories. The latter offer comfortable rides for 2-3 passengers, while riding a stand-up is always a solo activity. There are six common categories of watercraft: Rec-Lite, Recreation, Luxury and Performance, Tow Sports and Sport Fishing. The original concept of a PWC can be traced back to a man by the name of Clayton Jacobsen. His simple craft was designed to let people ski across water without the need to use a larger boat. The Jet Ski didn't come into the spotlight until Kawasaki decided to mass produce them, giving it the name we know today.
            Jetski has a jet propulsion engine, which has an impeller that uses rotating fan blades to suck water into the engine and then forcefully eject it. These two motions—sucking in water and then ejecting it back out—are what propel the jet ski forward. Jet skis have throttles, similar to those on motorcycles.</p>

            Kayaking is a fun water sport adventure. It involves the use of kayak, a narrowboat with a double- blade paddle to move on water. The driver is supposed to navigate through the waterways by sitting face-forward and marching ahead with alternating side-to-side paddle strokes. Kayaking was originally invented for hunting.
            Kayaks are a kind of boat that is slim and small is used by a limited number of people, often a single person at a time. It has another name called as a canoe.
            Kayaking is one such adventure sport that is gradually gaining prominence in our country. One of many reasons we love kayaking is that its one of the greenest ways to get out on the water without disrupting local ecosystem. Kayaks are completely sustainable, which means no gasoline, no oil, no sound pollution from motors.
            Kayaking is not as hard to learn as you might think. You need a guide or instructor to help you learn how to enter and exit a kayak, how to perform the forward stroke and the sweep stroke for turning the boat and a few lessons on safety.
            Kayaking can be dangerous if you don't know what to avoid and how to prepare. But if you're knowledgeable about kayaking obstacles, prepared for the weather and carry the proper safety gear then kayaking is an extremely safe and fun activity to enjoy on the water.
            Different types of kayaks: white water kayaks, junior kayaks, touring kayaks, sea kayaks, recreational kayaks, sit-on-top kayaks.
            White water kayaking is a popular adventure sport around the world that gives thrills and chills similar to white water rafting.</p>

                Rafting is a sport in which rafters use an inflatable raft to race with others. The team that reaches the destination first wins the race. The racing is done on white water or rough water of different degrees. The rafters use double blades to paddle the boat.
            White water rafting is a recreational water sport where an inflatable raft carries 4 to 8 people down white water rapids on a river. White water river rafting is considered an adventure sport and has varying levels of difficulty.
            The name white water comes from the churning white water created when a river is in full flow over obstacles. It is the mixture of rapids and waterfalls that give the river its white, foamy appearance. The white water is caused by the turbulence of the water as it cascades over rocks and boulders. “Rapids means an extremely fast moving part of a river, 
            caused by a steep descent or a rock in the riverbed</p>

                  Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on a board attached to a rider's feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. Snowboarding, winter sport with roots in skiing, surfing, and skateboarding where the primary activity is riding down any snow-covered surface while standing on a snowboard with feet positioned roughly perpendicular to the board and its direction, further differentiating it from skiing, in which riders face forward. Various snowboarding styles: freestyle, freeride, alpine, jibbing, slopestyle, big air, half-pipe, snowboard cross, snowboard racing. Snowboards are the basic equipment for snowboarding and are used for sliding over the snow filled surface. Usually the snowboard is made of hard wood core that is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibre glass. Other elements like carbon fibre, Kevlar, aluminium are also used in the making of a modern snowboard. There are two snowboard stances, regular and goofy. A regular stance means that your left foot is forward, while a goofy stance means that your right foot is forward. There is no correct snowboard stance, it is all about what feels good to you. While snowboarding, you use your quadriceps and hamstrings to push forward and your calves to guide and turn the board. You also engage your core to remain balanced as well as your feet and ankles to stay upright. Snowboarding are thrilling activities and great workouts. Both sports are excellent cardiovascular exercises that strengthen the heart. Because they are also weight-bearing exercises, they strengthen your bones as they tone your muscles. Snowboarding are great for your mental health, as they help relieve stress and anxiety.
                   Being in the fresh air and surrounded by beautiful scenery can do wonders for your mental wellbeing.

                  Zip lining is an action-filled recreational activity that involves riding a steel cable on a protective seat or a belt between two points and generally on a valley that exhibits spectacular sceneries. A zip line is, at its most simple, a cable that starts at a higher point than it ends. Using the natural decline of the slope, a person or cargo can travel down the wire on a pulley system that minimizes friction to help the rider accelerate. A zipline also referred to as zip line, sypline, zip wire, aerial ropeslide, flying fox, etc. is an outdoor recreation 
                  sport/adventure sport where a freely moving pulley is used to ride from the top to the bottom of an inclined cable.

                <p class="post-description">Bungee jumping is an action-filled recreational activity that involves head-first jumping from a tall structure with an elastic cord attached into participants' feet. That tall structure can be a building, crane, bridge or even a helicopter. The word "bungee" originates from West Country dialect of the English language, meaning "Anything thick and squat", as defined by James Jennings in his book "Observations of Some of the Dialects in The West of England" published 1825. In 1928, the word started to be used for a rubber eraser.Today, bungee cords are most often used to secure objects without tying knots and to absorb shock. Inexpensive bungee cords, with metal or plastic hooks on each end, are marketed as a general utility item. Now, many fitness studios around the world offer bungee workouts. A bungee workout can enhance your coordination, boost your strength, and skyrocket your confidence. 
                  It's a cardiovascular workout minus the impact, so it's gentler on the body's joints.</p>

It is one of the most exhilarating, and unique, ski activities that you can do. Loading up a helicopter with some of your best friends and heli-skiing at Tyax Lodge is a once in a lifetime opportunity.The sport has been around for decades and it first hit the mainstream in the sixties, but the practice of using a helicopter to get to hard-to-reach places had been around in the Alps and in Alaska since the fifties. But opposition on social and environmental grounds led to France outlawing it in 1985.</p>
