            <h2 >Surfing</h2>
            Surfing is a great way to stay in shape, have fun, and enjoy the outdoors. Surfing can be a great 
way to relax, have fun, and get some exercise. It's also a great way to meet new people and see 
new places. Surfing in India is growing in popularity. There are some outstanding spots along the country's 
vast coastline where you can catch a wave and also learn to surf. The only issue is that the waves 
aren't consistent and the surf does fall flat at times. You need to be at the right place at the right 
time!<br>
Waves generally rise between three and five feet most of the year. Bigger and faster world-class 
waves (of over eight feet), suited to advanced or professional surfers, can be experienced just 
before and during the monsoon from May to September. You can expect plenty of rain with them 
though! The big swells decline from October to December, after which conditions return to 
normal gentle waves.
<br><br><h2>Why do people choose surfing?</h2>
Surfing increases your strength, balance and fitness, not only that but simply spending time in the ocean positively impacts your health. Along with becoming fit you will also become confident. Learning to surf, you will need courage to take on different conditions and grow your confidence!<br>

        <p><h2 id="Kovalam Beach">Kovalam Beach</h2>
            Kovalam surf is really the only place on the Keralan coast that can match the upcoming surf 
            haven of Varkala. Still not quite receiving the same attention as its brother to the north, this one 
            is largely the province of local surf schools playing their trade with holidaying Indians out of the 
            big city. The surf is very fickle, with beach breaks that froth one day and die to nan bread 
            flatness the next. But there are some points mixed in here that can show quality, offering up 
            some of the hollower rides on the subcontinent.What’s undeniably beguiling is the vibe. 
            Kovalam is chilled and charming. Its beaches slope down from steep cliffs threaded by big palms 
            onto crescent bays. There are lovely hotels and some particularly welcoming surf outfitters that 
            are fantastic for showing total learners the ropes. We’d sum it up like this: Don’t come here 
            specifically for the surfing. Come for the sun, the coconuts, and the hotels and do some surfing 
            on the side.<br>

        <p><h2 id="Mahabalipuram">Mahabalipuram </h2>
            Surfing is our passion, it is a connection with nature, a way of life and simply fun was raised in 
            a fishing community in the beautiful Mahabalipuram (home of the famous shore temple).After 
            working as a diving instructor for several years, Mukesh founded Mumu Surf School as the first 
            surf shop near Chennai with intimate knowledge of the sea and the waves.He is a qualified ISA 
            Instructor with a Surf Rescue license, a PADI Divemaster and Rescue Scuba Diver.
            Now, Mukesh and his wife Anna run the Surf School right at the Main Beach of Mahabalipuram. 
            The attached “Sandy Bottom Café” offers healthy, nutritious, fresh food and drinks for the tired 
            surfers after a session in the waves.

        <p><h2 id="Pondicherry">Pondicherry </h2>
            Pondicherry offers a lot of adventure sports to try out new things. Surfing is one of the popular 
            adventure sports for tourists who are visiting Pondicherry. There are three surfing schools on the 
            serenity beach in Kottakuppam near Pondicherry – Guru Surfing School, Kallialay Surf School 
            and Mother Ocean Surf School. Serenity beach in Kottakuppam is just 4 km away from White 
            town, Pondicherry city, and it has palm trees, rocks, and the beauty of the Bay of Bengal. <br><br>
            <img src="images/India/Surfing/Photos and videos/Surfing (3).jpg" width="500px" height="400px" alt="Surfing"><br><br>

            the package. You can enjoy your surfing activity between 10 AM and 4 PM.
            <br> <br>
            <h4>Best time to go  Pondicherry Beach:</h4>  The surfing season at Pondicherry is long, with waves of up to 12 feet 
             from June to January. Much of the action takes place at Serenity Beach, where surf breaks were 
             created by two long piers that were built to protect the beach following the devastating 2004 
             tsunami.<br><br>

        <a href="#top">back to top</a><br><br>

        <p><h2 id="Varkala"> Varkala </h2>
            Varkala in Kerala is an exposed beach break that has inconsistent surf. The best wind direction is 
            from the east northeast. Most of the surf here comes from groundswells and the ideal swell 
            direction is from the southwest. The beach breaks offer lefts and rights.
            If you can catch Papanasam Beach when the sandbars are in the right place then there's a chance 
            that S-SW swells will give a series of peaky beach breaks that form both left and right shoulders. 
            It's a lovely place to surf, since you'll probably be all alone <br><br>

          <h2>Essentials for SkyDiving : </h2>
        <p>Stave off head trauma, surfer's ear and pesky cuts with these three nifty items of surf safety equipment: helmet, earplugs and reef boots.</p><br>
      
        <h3>1.The Surfboard </h3>
        <p>The magic carpet that enables you to ride waves.There are several types of surfboards for different wave conditions and experience levels.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2.The Fins</h3>
        <p>Surf fins are the wheels of a surfboard and provide stability, performance, and drive.The most popular fin setups that can be found on a surfboard are single-fin, twin-fin, thruster,quad, and five-fin setups.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>3.The Leash </h3>
        <p>The leash is the rope that keeps the surfer connected to the surfboard.
            There's no science behind it, but if you fall or wipe out, the board will be right next to you.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>4.There's Suit</h3>
        <p>The neoprene garment that allows surfers to stay in cold and cool waters for a long time.There are two main types of wetsuits (spring suit and full suit) and three main thickness levels (2mm, 3/2mm, and 4/3mm)</p><br>
        <h3>6.The Surfboard Bag</h3>
        <p>Surfboards are sensitive objects, and bags protect them from accidents and elements.A good travel bag will help you carry the surfboard on surf trips and long walks to the beach.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>6.The Boardshorts</h3>
        <p>There are specific boardshort models for surfers with quick-drying, stitchless, and stretch fabrics.If the weather conditions allow, all you need is a surfboard and a pair of surf trunks</p>
