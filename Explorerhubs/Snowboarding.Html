            Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on a board attached to a rider's feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. Snowboarding, winter sport with roots in skiing, surfing, and skateboarding where the primary activity is riding down any snow-covered surface while standing on a snowboard with feet positioned roughly perpendicular to the board and its direction, further differentiating it from skiing, in which riders face forward. Various snowboarding styles: freestyle, freeride, alpine, jibbing, slopestyle, big air, half-pipe, snowboard cross, snowboard racing. Snowboards are the basic equipment for snowboarding and are used for sliding over the snow filled surface. Usually the snowboard is made of hard wood core that is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibre glass. Other elements like carbon fibre, Kevlar, aluminium are also used in the making of a modern snowboard. There are two snowboard stances, regular and goofy. A regular stance means that your left foot is forward, while a goofy stance means that your right foot is forward. There is no correct snowboard stance, it is all about what feels good to you. While snowboarding, you use your quadriceps and hamstrings to push forward and your calves to guide and turn the board. You also engage your core to remain balanced as well as your feet and ankles to stay upright. Snowboarding are thrilling activities and great workouts.
